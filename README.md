Write a Java program to demonstrate the Singleton pattern. The key parts of the singleton pattern are: A private static variable to store the single instance called the singleton A public static method for callers to get a reference to the instance A private constructor so no callers can instantiate the object directly Using these key parts, write a Java program that will allow a user of the program to assign only one runner to each of the 8 lanes of running track in a field. Include a brief documentation (in the code or in a separate document) to explain the input (if any), processing and output of the program. /* * Individual: Singleton Pattern Program * Instructions: * Write a Java program (non-GUI preferred) to demonstrate the Singleton * pattern. * * Using these key parts, write a Java program that will allow a user of the * program to assign only one runner to each of the 8 lanes of running * track in a field. * * Include a brief documentation (in the code or in a separate document) * to explain the input (if any), processing and output of the program. * Submit your assignment using the Assignment Files tab above. */
